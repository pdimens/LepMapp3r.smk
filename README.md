# LepWrap

LepWrap is a reusable pipeline to use the linkage map software [Lep-Map3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lep-map3/). It is the Snakemake-based successor to [LepMapp3r](https://github.com/pdimens/LepMapp3r). Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/pdimens/LepWrap/wiki) for detailed installation, usage, and workflow information.



### How to install
You will need a `conda` installation ([Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)), along with cloning this repository locally. I recommend Miniconda.

#### 1. Cloning LepWrap
Download a zip of this repository using the "Code" button on the top-right and unzip it on your machine or:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdimens/LepWrap.git
```

#### 2. Installing other dependencies
Assuming you have `anaconda` or `miniconda` installed:
```bash
cd LepWrap
conda env create -f conda_setup.yml
```
This will create an environment called `lepwrap` that can be activated with:
```bash
conda activate lepwrap
```

### How to run
You will need to modify `config.yaml` to suit your needs, then you can simply run the pipeline with the wrapper:
```bash
./LepWrap <number_of_cores>
```
where `<number_of_cores>` is an integer of the maximum number of cores/threads you want the pipeline to use.

### Something to keep in mind
LepWrap does things a certain way, employing the most common/reasonable way of using Lep-Map3 (and LepAnchor more or less). Version `3.2+` is **a lot** more flexible that its predecessors, but might still lack something you're looking for. Your study is unique, and I encourage youto clone/fork this repository and adapt LepWrap to your needs! All of the code in LepWrap is written in human-readable bash or aggressively annotated R, so give it a shot and adapt it to your workflow. PR's always welcome!
