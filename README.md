# LepWrap

LepWrap is a reusable pipeline to use the linkage map software [Lep-Map3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lep-map3/). It is the Snakemake-based successor to [LepMapp3r](https://github.com/pdimens/LepMapp3r). Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/pdimens/LepWrap/wiki) for detailed installation, usage, and workflow information.



### How to install
You will need a `conda` installation (Anaconda or Miniconda), along with cloning this repository locally.

#### 1. Cloning LepWrap
Download a zip of this repository using the "Code" button on the top-right and unzip it on your machine or:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdimens/LepWrap.git
```

#### 2. Installing other dependencies
Assuming you have `anaconda` or `miniconda` installed:
```bash
cd LepWrap
conda create -f conda_LepWrap.yml
```
This will create an environment called `lepwrap` that can be activated with:
```bash
conda activate lepwrap
```

### How to run
You will need to modify `config.yaml` to suit your needs, then you can simply run the pipeline with the wrapper:
```bash
./LepWrap <number_of_cores>
```
where `<number_of_cores>` is an integer of the maximum number of cores/threads you want the pipeline to use.

### Something to keep in mind

Lep-Map3 is a **very** comprehensive software, and LepWrap doesn't incorporate all the features and nuances. Your study is unique, so you are encouraged to clone or fork this repo and adapt LepWrap to your needs! All of the code in LepWrap is written in human-readable bash or aggressively annotated R, so give it a shot and adapt it to your workflow. If using LepWrap in a publication, cite **Pasi Rastas** for his work on Lep-Map3 and please include a link to this repository.
